Emily the Personal Assistant for Slack

Recently started learning python and I wanted to build a slackbot for personal assistance.

Meet Emily. All she can do right now is tell you the weather right now, or in a location in the United States.

Next step is to integrate google calendar, so Emily can fetch my agenda for the day.
